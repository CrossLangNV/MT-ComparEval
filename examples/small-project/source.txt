They travel at night, spend the day at the `Wiesn' and head back home again at 10:30 PM.
Staying over night would only generate unnecessary costs, Marco says.
The trip is 75 Euros, including a welcoming round of Kaiser beer, brewed according to the Bavarian Purity Law, health insurance, as well as a German-language guide - Marco enrolled in a language course in Frankfurt.
And with no further ado, the buses head out into the night, on the autostrada leading to `Brennero.'
There is no beer to be had yet.
Soon all is quiet in the bus, the travelers are asleep.
As they should be - they are going to need their strength.
They stop in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where droves of other buses with Italian plates are making a final stop on the Autobahn 8, right before Munich.
When Marco's group finally arrives, as planned, at half past six in the morning at a parking lot near Theresienwiese, about 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather. Marco addresses them one last time to give them their marching orders.
First up: Put on the yellow caps.
On the left side, they say `Oktoberfest' in Gothic type, next to the Internet address of Marco's travel agency, "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: `When the doors of the beer tent open, you have to run!' Marco shouts into the morning.
`Run!' Run and man the seats in the rear part of the tent.
`Not in the front, or else we will block the entry. And not all yellow hats at the same tables - spread out in the room!'
It's 8.25 Euros per `Ma√ü,' Marco screams.
And don't forget to tip.
`Show the security people that we behave!
As soon as you abandon your seats, they're gone!'
Third: `Be back here tonight at 10:30 sharp!' Understood?
